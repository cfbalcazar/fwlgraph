This Stata program, created by [Tim Foreman](https://timforeman.net/2018/02/12/visualizing-relationship-after-controls/), allows one to visualize the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable of interest.  The approach is motivated by the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem (one of my favorite theorems!).  It is quite useful to visualize what the regression with control variables is actually representing, which can help one determine whether a linear or other specification might make sense, as well as visually identifying outliers.
